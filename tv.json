			 "excerpt": "MDMA can alter perceptions of others during an actual social interaction (Baggott et al., 2016; Bedi et al., 2014; Wardle and De Wit, 2014). Typically in these studies, participants perform a brief speech task with a research assistant and subsequently rate their interaction with the research assistant. In one study (Wardle and De Wit, 2014), MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) modestly increased the degree to which participants felt the research assistant understood and was interested in them. Interestingly, this effect is distinguishable from reports that the drug increased empathy for others. Here, MDMA increased perceptions of empathy from others. This appears consistent with the report by Baggott et al. (2016) that MDMA increased the comfort participants felt when describing autobiographical memories to a researcher. Increased feelings of being understood and accepted by real others provides additional evidence for the drug’s benefits in strengthening therapist–patient alliances in psychotherapy settings (Bouso et al., 2008; Johansen and Krebs, 2009; Mithoefer et al., 2011).",

MDMA did not affect the overall structure of participants’ speech. These findings were confirmed in an additional sample through a standardized dictionary method and machine learning, indicating that MDMA increased the use of social words, as well as words connoting positive and negative emotions [280].
