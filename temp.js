"excerpt": "MDMA not only exhibits some amphetamine-like properties but also shows hallucinogenic-like effects and can be considered an intermediate substance between a pure stimulant like D-amphetamine and a pure hallucinogenic drug like LSD. MDMA acutely induces feelings of well-being, love, empathy, and prosociality [14, 15], and produces mild perceptual alterations that are thought to be primarily mediated by the release of serotonin (5-HT) [16, 17] and norepinephrine [18], and the direct activation of 5-HT2A receptors [19]. Additionally, MDMA releases oxytocin [14, 20, 21], which may contribute to the mediation of its prosocial effects [22, 23]. The unique emotional effects of MDMA lead to its classification as an empathogen or entactogen [24], referring to assumingly distinct effects from psychostimulants [25,26,27,28]. Psychostimulants such as D-amphetamine and methamphetamine primarily activate dopamine and norepinephrine systems, with only minimal effects on 5-HT [29, 30], and promote stimulation, wakefulness, and concentration without the MDMA-typical emotional effects [25, 27, 28, 31,32,33,34,35]. Although MDMA produces less profound changes in perception compared with classic hallucinogens, it is often also classified as a psychedelic substance.",

Vollenweider et al found that orally administered MDMA at a dose of 1.5 to 1.7 mg/kg produced some of the same effects as the classic hallucinogen psilocybin (eg, depersonalization, perceptual disturbances, and thought disorder), but, in contrast to psilocybin, there was little in the way of overt hallucinations.24",

"excerpt": "MDMA is generally classified as an “entactogen” or “empathogen” because its socio- emotional effects differ from those of prototypic stimulants (Bershad et al., 2016; Hysek et al., 2014b; Schmid et al., 2014), and it produces fewer perceptual alterations than hallucinogens (Schmid et al., 2015a). Specifically, MDMA increases feelings of closeness to others, trust, and openness and enhances emotional empathy for positive situations (Hysek et al., 2014a; Schmid et al., 2014). Such effects are not observed with stimulants that predominantly act on the DA system (Schmid et al., 2014). MDMA (Baggott et al., 2016) but not D-amphetamine (Childs et al., 2016) decreased social anxiety. MDMA selectively impaired the recognition of negative emotions (Hysek et al., 2014a; Schmid et al., 2014; Bedi et al., 2010; Wardle et al., 2014), whereas such stimulants as amphetamine and methylphenidate nonselectively enhanced the recognition of emotions (Hysek et al., 2014b; Schmid et al., 2014; Wardle et al., 2012). These findings indicate that MDMA produces unique effects on emotion processing in healthy subjects that are likely linked to its predominant effects on the 5-HT system (Bershad et al., 2016; Hysek et al., 2012d; Hysek et al., 2012b) and may be useful in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (Sessa, 2016).",

In contrast, MDMA preferentially increases serotonin and norepinephrine release (Rothman et al., 2001; Rudnick and Wall, 1992) and induces dopamine release indirectly as a consequence of serotonergic release (Gudelsky and Nash, 1996; Koch and Galloway, 1997). MDMA directly inhibits dopamine reuptake (Verrico et al., 2007). In a recent review, Liechti (2015) hypothesized that this high ratio of serotonergic to dopaminergic effects is key for producing MDMA-like effects, and that similar drugs with a lower ratio produce more familiar, prototypic stimulant effects.",

Entactogens contain a ring-substituted amphetamine core, belong to the phenethylamine class of psychoactive drugs, and are described as promoting acceptance and compassion for self and others, changing recognition and response to emotions, and increased interpersonal closeness [19, 40, 70, 71].

Interestingly, the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin (0.16 mg/kg) appears to have similar effects on amygdala reactivity as MDMA, dampening responses to negative emotional faces (Kraehenmann et al., 2015). Taken together, these findings indicate that MDMA has distinctive effects on emotional processing compared with amphetamine at the neural level. These findings help to explain why MDMA reduces social anxiety (i.e. by reducing responses to negative or threatening social stimuli and increasing responses to positive stimuli), and may also lend support for the idea that these effects are partly a result of the drug’s serotonergic activity.",

"excerpt": "Relative to placebo, MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) increased the use of sexual, social, and emotional words (Baggott et al., 2016) and the use of positive emotion words (Wardle and De Wit, 2014). In a study comparing MDMA and methamphetamine, Bedi et al. (2014) reported that speech following 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA had greater semantic proximity to concepts of “friend, support, intimacy, and rapport,” and 0.75 mg/kg had greater proximity to empathy. By contrast, methamphetamine (20 mg) did not increase the social content of speech. Thus, while both MDMA and prototypic stimulant drugs affect speech, their effects appear to be different, perhaps reflecting the different character of their social effects.",

"excerpt": "Thus, by these measures, there are clear differences between classic stimulants and MDMA. Interestingly, the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin (0.16 mg/kg) appears to have similar effects on amygdala reactivity as MDMA, dampening responses to negative emotional faces (Kraehenmann et al., 2015). Taken together, these findings indicate that MDMA has distinctive effects on emotional processing compared with amphetamine at the neural level. These findings help to explain why MDMA reduces social anxiety (i.e. by reducing responses to negative or threatening social stimuli and increasing responses to positive stimuli), and may also lend support for the idea that these effects are partly a result of the drug’s serotonergic activity.",

Additionally, MDMA releases serotonin (Hysek et al. 2012c; White et al. 1996) and oxytocin (Dumont et al. 2009; Hysek et al. 2012b; Hysek et al. 2014a; Kuypers et al. 2017; Schmid et al. 2014; Thompson et al. 2007), whereas methylphenidate and modafinil act as dopamine uptake inhibitors (Madras et al. 2006; Rothman et al. 2001). Consistent with the different pharmacological profiles of these substances, MDMA exerted distinct subjective effects across all of our rating scales (VASs, AMRS, ARCI, 5D-ASC, and SADI) compared with methylphenidate and modafinil at the doses used. Consistent with the present study, we previously reported greater well-being, happiness, extroversion, and feelings of closeness after 125 mg MDMA administration compared with 60 mg methylphenidate (Hysek et al. 2014b) and after 75 mg MDMA administration compared with 40 mg methylphenidate (Schmid et al. 2014).",

"excerpt": "The present study clearly indicated that MDMA has a different effect profile than the stimulant methylphenidate at the doses used, supporting previous, albeit less rigorous, study findings (Bershad et al. 2016; Hysek et al. 2014b; Schmid et al. 2015b; Schmid et al. 2014). Specifically, MDMA increased well-being, good drug effects, drug liking, happiness, trust, feelings of closeness to others, and wanting to be with others, and reduced state anxiety compared with methylphenidate and modafinil at the doses used. The distinct mood effects of MDMA were congruent with its effects on the [Facial Emotion Recognition Task FERT], including reductions of fear recognition and more misclassifications of emotions as happy. MDMA, but not methylphenidate, has previously been shown to reduce fear recognition on the [Facial Emotion Recognition Task FERT] (Bedi et al. 2010; Hysek et al. 2014b; Kirkpatrick et al. 2014b; Schmid et al. 2014). Additionally, MDMA, but not methylphenidate or modafinil, strongly increased endocrine markers of acutely increased serotonergic activity, including cortisol and prolactin (Seifritz et al. 1996; Sommers et al. 1994; Strajhar et al. 2016). MDMA, but not methylphenidate or modafinil, also markedly increased pupil size at rest and after light stimulation, which is consistent with a previous study (Hysek and Liechti 2012) and other serotonergic substances (Schmid et al. 2015a). On the [Addiction Research Center Inventory ARCI], methylphenidate and modafinil produced significantly fewer sedating effects than MDMA, which is consistent with their greater stimulant-type properties.",

"excerpt": "The primary research question was whether MDMA is simply a stimulant or whether it has unique namely prosocial and empathogenic effects that are distinct from other stimulants (Bershad et al. 2016). The present study clearly indicated that MDMA has a different effect profile than the stimulant methylphenidate at the doses used, supporting previous, albeit less rigorous, study findings (Bershad et al. 2016; Hysek et al. 2014b; Schmid et al. 2015b; Schmid et al. 2014). Specifically, MDMA increased well-being, good drug effects, drug liking, happiness, trust, feelings of closeness to others, and wanting to be with others, and reduced state anxiety compared with methylphenidate and modafinil at the doses used. The distinct mood effects of MDMA were congruent with its effects on the [Facial Emotion Recognition Task FERT], including reductions of fear recognition and more misclassifications of emotions as happy. MDMA, but not methylphenidate, has previously been shown to reduce fear recognition on the [Facial Emotion Recognition Task FERT] (Bedi et al. 2010; Hysek et al. 2014b; Kirkpatrick et al. 2014b; Schmid et al. 2014). Additionally, MDMA, but not methylphenidate or modafinil, strongly increased endocrine markers of acutely increased serotonergic activity, including cortisol and prolactin (Seifritz et al. 1996; Sommers et al. 1994; Strajhar et al. 2016).

Prototypic stimulants increases self-reported feelings of friendliness, increase some aspects of verbal behavior, increase positive responses to stimuli (regardless of social or emotional content), and increase sexual arousal. MDMA more specifi- cally increases self-reported feelings of trust and generosity, increases responses to social and emotionally valenced stimuli, increases empa- thy, and increases the social and emotional themes in spontaneous speech.",

In contrast, d-amphetamine (10 mg, 20 mg) enhanced positive emotional responses in general, but its effects were not specific to stimuli with social content (Wardle and De Wit, 2012).

Through natural language processing (NLP), researchers found speech patterns after MDMA were distinct from those produced after methamphetamine and placebo [40]. Proximity of speech to the concepts of friend, support, intimacy, rapport, and empathy was increased in the MDMA drug condition, which may bear some significance for the use of MDMA in therapy. MDMA did not affect the overall structure of participants’ speech. These findings were confirmed in an additional sample through a standardized dictionary method and machine learning, indicating that MDMA increased the use of social words, as well as words connoting positive and negative emotions [280]. There is some evidence that the increases in affiliative and prosocial feelings are separable from romantic or sexual feelings.",
